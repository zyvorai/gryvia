# Placement simulator (no GPUs needed)

`operators/ai-operator/cmd/placement-sim` runs a [Janus](https://github.com/zyvorai/janus) cluster config and workload through the operator's real node-selection code (`scheduler.FindOptimalNodesHeld`) using a fake Kubernetes client.

```bash
cd operators/ai-operator
go run ./cmd/placement-sim -config ../../../janus/configs/clusters/small_h100.yaml
```

It prints makespan, mean wait, GPU utilisation, jobs completed/unschedulable and GPU-memory violations. `-backfill=false` makes the queue head block (Janus' `fifo` backfills, so the default matches it).

## What it models

Whole-GPU jobs, nodes as bins of GPUs, arrival-order queue with optional backfill, multi-node jobs when `gpu_count` exceeds the largest node. It does **not** model NVLink/PCIe topology penalties, MIG, preemption, gang timeouts, inference serving, or GPU memory as a constraint (violations are only counted).

## Agreement with Janus

On the Janus cluster configs without those features (`priority_fifo`, `single_gpu`, `rl_small`, `preemption_priority`) the numbers match Janus exactly. On `small_h100` the makespan is 7800 s here against 8294.67 s in Janus, the difference being exactly Janus' 494.67 s topology inflation. Configs that use preemption, MIG, gang timeouts or topology differ, as expected.

This checks placement quality only. It says nothing about NCCL, RDMA, eBPF or training performance, which still need hardware.

## Finding

The default scoring prefers the node with the most free GPUs, so it spreads single-GPU jobs and a later whole-node job waits for a node to drain (`TestSpreadingScoreFragmentsWholeNodeJobs`: two 1-GPU jobs plus a 4-GPU job on 2x4 GPUs gives makespan 110 s instead of 100 s).
