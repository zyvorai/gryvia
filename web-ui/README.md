# Gryvia Web UI

React dashboard for the Gryvia GPU orchestration platform. The look follows the sibling `netra` project:
its stylesheets are copied verbatim into `src/styles/netra*.css` (do not hand-edit them) and Gryvia-specific
additions live in `src/styles/gryvia.css`. Light or dark follows the system setting and can be toggled.

## Features

- **Dashboard** - cluster stats, GPU utilization, job pipeline, links into the pages behind each number
- **Jobs** - searchable, filterable, sortable table (state lives in the URL, so views are shareable); submit, clone,
  delete; job details show conditions, pods, logs (tail) and events
- **Workspaces, Models, Inference, Workflows, Tuner** - list pages with the same table controls, detail panels,
  create forms and confirmations; structured editors for tuner parameter spaces and workflow steps (with DAG
  validation) and an "Advanced: edit as JSON" escape hatch
- **Quotas, Nodes, Costs** - team quotas and budgets, GPU node health, spend to date; drill-down links to the jobs
  they own
- **Network and Security** - interactive service graph, observed flows, flow policies (`?new=1` prefill), trace
  sessions, security policies, GPU communication analysis. Empty states name the operator or collector that feeds the
  data instead of showing reassuring zeros
- **Auth** - login (admin credentials or a bearer key), session-expiry handling that returns you to the page you were on
- **Accessibility** - skip link, focus moves to the page on navigation, modal focus trap and Escape, keyboard-operable
  rows, `aria-sort` headers, per-page document titles
- **Resilience** - in-shell error boundary with retry, stale-data indicator, toasts for every mutation

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** + **TypeScript** on **Vite**
- **React Router** (lazy routes), **TanStack Query** (polling; no retry on 4xx)
- **Recharts** for charts
- Plain global CSS with netra design tokens (no Tailwind)
- **Vitest** + Testing Library (jsdom)

## Development

```bash
cd web-ui
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to a gateway on localhost:8001
npm run build    # production build to dist/
npm run lint     # ESLint, zero warnings allowed
npm test         # unit and component tests
npx tsc --noEmit # type check
```

## API

The UI talks only to the Gryvia API Gateway. All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the token comes
from the login screen (stored in `localStorage` as `gryvia_token`). See
[`services/api-gateway/README.md`](../services/api-gateway/README.md) and the
[API reference](../website/docs/developer-guide/api-reference.md) for the routes, including the job runtime routes
`GET /api/jobs/{name}/pods|logs|events`.

Typed responses and request bodies live in `src/lib/api.ts`.

## Deployment

The UI is served over HTTPS by nginx (port 8443, NodePort 32443 by default) and proxies `/api/` to the gateway.
The certificate is self-signed and shared through the `gryvia-tls` Secret. Deploy everything with:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-remote.sh <host> <ssh-user>
```
