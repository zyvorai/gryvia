# Gryvia — deploy guards, sourced on the target host by scripts/deploy-remote.sh.
#
# Why this exists. deploy-remote.sh builds the images on the host and imports them
# into k3s's containerd under a FIXED tag (ghcr.io/zyvorai/gryvia-gpu-operator:1.0.0), then
# runs `helm upgrade`. Kubelet garbage-collects images that no pod uses once the
# disk passes its high threshold (85% by default). A freshly imported image is
# unused until the new pod starts, so on a disk near that line the controller
# image can be collected in the gap, and the new pod fails with ImagePullBackOff
# ("NotFound": the fixed tag is not on any registry). Helm still reports success,
# `rollout status` only times out, and the controller stays down. That took the
# live controller down for about ten minutes; rolling back does not help, because
# the previous revision uses the same tag.
#
# So the deploy now (1) says so when the disk is close to the GC line, (2) makes
# sure each image is present right before helm and again after, re-importing it
# from the local build if it is missing, and (3) waits for the pods to be Ready,
# recognising ImagePullBackOff and repairing it, instead of trusting helm.
#
# Every function reads its environment, so scripts/ci-deploy-guards.sh can test
# them against stubbed df, kubectl, k3s and podman.

# `rollout restart` the previous pod is still Running and Ready and the replacement
# has not been created yet, so "every matching pod is Ready" is already true and a
# wait built on it returns at once (the first live use of this function did exactly
# that and reported success while the new pods were still starting). `rollout status`
# only succeeds once the new pods are available and the old ones are gone.
#
# It is polled in short slices so a pod stuck pulling its image can be repaired in
# between: re-import the image, then delete only the stuck pod so it is recreated
# immediately rather than after kubelet's back-off. On timeout it prints the pods
# and returns 1, so the deploy fails loudly instead of reporting a success helm
